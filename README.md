## Express PropelAuth Starter

This repo contains a forkable Express backend which uses [PropelAuth](https://www.propelauth.com/?utm_campaign=github) to validate access tokens sent from your frontend.

[Here](https://docs.propelauth.com/example-apps/apps) are guides which will walk you through the code in this repo.

You can use this with any compatible frontend, like the [React PropelAuth Starter](https://github.com/PropelAuth/react-frontend-starter)
